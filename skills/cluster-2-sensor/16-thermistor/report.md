#  Thermistor

Author: Vanessa Schuweh, 2019-10-08

## Summary

In this skill, I wired a bare wire thermistor in a voltage divider and connected it to the ESP through an ADC port. My code takes the input of millivolts from the sensor and converts it into engineering units of degrees celsius. The conversion calculation comes from the data sheet/ specs of the thermistor.
