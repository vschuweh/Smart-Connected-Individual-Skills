#  IP Chat

Author: Vanessa Schuweh, 2019-10-24

## Summary
In this skill, I demonstrated communication between my ESP32 and my laptop on the network. I used the udp_client as my base code but configured idf.py menuconfig to allow my ESP to connect to our Group_7 WiFi Network and sent a message over WiFi between the two.
