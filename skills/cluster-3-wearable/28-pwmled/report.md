#  Use PWM to control power delivery to LEDs

Author: Vanessa Schuweh, 2019-10-24

## Summary
In this skill, I controlled the brightness of an LED by automatically fading and incrementing from 0 to 9. I used the ESP ledc code example as my base code and modified it to fade. I also created a separate file using case statements to increment the brightness by using 0 to 9 on the keyboard.
