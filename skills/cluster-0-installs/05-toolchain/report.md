#  Setup Espressif Toolchain

Author: Vanessa Schuweh, 2019-09-06

## Summary

In this skill, I installed the USB driver from Silabs then followed the Espressif Getting started Guide to install prerequisites, ESP-IDF, set up tools and environment variables. I verified that my toolchain worked by having Hello World show up on the console. I then repeated the process but this time had the LED blink on the ESP32.
