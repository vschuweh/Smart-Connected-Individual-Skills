#  MicroLIDAR

Author: Vindhya Kuchibhotla, Jennifer Norell, Vanessa Schuweh, 2019-11-08

## Summary
For this skill we used a MicroLIDAR sensor to measure distance. We did this by using UART to read values coming through, store them in a buffer and then parse this data. We look specifically for two header bits (both are 0x59) followed by two bits used to find the distance.
